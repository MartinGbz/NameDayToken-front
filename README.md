# Abstract

This repo is a frontend that allows users to **mint** and **deploy** [NameDayTokens](#namedaytokens).

➡️ Live on https://name-day-token.vercel.app/

# NameDayTokens

NameDayTokens are ERC-20 mintable by addresses with specific ENS names and transferable only during the specific name day.

Example: You setup an Alice token that is mintable by all \*alice\*.eth holders and only transferable during Alice's day (16/12 of each year).
